The formula lends itself to a simple and compact algorithm that can efficiently compute any low odd-degree isogenies inside the supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) key exchange protocol. Our implementation of this algorithm shows that, beyond the commonly used 3-isogenies, there is a moderate degradation in relative performance of                                                                                   {\$}{\$}(2d+1){\$}{\$}                                                                                            (                          2                          d                          +                          1                          )                                                                                    -isogenies as d grows, but that larger values of d can now be used in practical SIDH implementations.},

A recent paper by Azarderakhsh, Jao, Kalach, Koziel and Leonardi showed that the public keys defined in Jao and De Feo's original SIDH scheme can be further compressed by around a factor of two, but reported that the performance penalty in utilizing this compression blew the overall SIDH runtime out by more than an order of magnitude. Given that the runtime of SIDH key exchange is currently its main drawback in relation to its lattice- and code-based post-quantum alternatives, an order of magnitude performance penalty for a factor of two improvement in bandwidth presents a trade-off that is unlikely to favor public-key compression in many scenarios.},

The main technical idea in our scheme is that we transmit the images of torsion bases under the isogeny in order to allow the two parties to arrive at a common shared key despite the noncommutativity of the endomorphism ring. Our work is motivated by the recent development of a subexponential-time quantum algorithm for constructing isogenies between ordinary elliptic curves. In the supersingular case, by contrast, the fastest known quantum attack remains exponential, since the noncommutativity of the endomorphism ring means that the approach used in the ordinary case does not apply. We give a precise formulation of the necessary computational assumption along with a discussion of its validity. In addition, we present implementation results showing that our protocols are multiple orders of magnitude faster than previous isogeny-based cryptosystems over ordinary curves.},

Many applications in cryptography require evaluating large degree isogenies between elliptic curves efficiently. For ordinary curves of the same endomorphism ring, the previous best known algorithm has a worst case running time which is exponential in the length of the input. In this paper we show this problem can be solved in subexponential time under reasonable heuristics. Our approach is based on factoring the ideal corresponding to the kernel of the isogeny, modulo principal ideals, into a product of smaller prime ideals for which the isogenies can be computed directly. Combined with previous work of Bostan et al., our algorithm yields equations for large degree isogenies in quasi-optimal time given only the starting curve and the kernel.},

  abstract  = {A recent paper by Costello and Hisil at Asiacrypt'17 presents efficient formulas for computing isogenies with odd-degree cyclic kernels on Montgomery curves. We provide a constructive proof of a generalization of this theorem which shows the connection between the shape of the isogeny and the simple action of the point                                                                                   {\$}{\$}(0,0){\$}{\$}                  . This generalization removes the restriction of a cyclic kernel and allows for any separable isogeny whose kernel does not contain                                                                                   {\$}{\$}(0,0){\$}{\$}                  . As a particular case, we provide efficient formulas for 2-isogenies between Montgomery curves and show that these formulas can be used in isogeny-based cryptosystems without expensive square root computations and without knowledge of a special point of order 8. We also consider elliptic curves in triangular form containing an explicit point of order 3.},

  abstract     = {A new general mathematical problem, suitable for public-key cryptosystems, is proposed: morphism computation in a category of Abelian groups. In connection with elliptic curves over finite fields, the problem becomes the following: compute an isogeny (an algebraic homomorphism) between the elliptic curves given. The problem seems to be hard for solving with a quantum computer. {ElGamal} public-key encryption and {Diffie-Hellman} key agreement are proposed for an isogeny cryptosystem. The paper describes theoretical background and a public-key encryption technique, followed by security analysis and consideration of cryptosystem parameters selection. A demonstrative example of encryption is included as well.},

In this system, a pair (Es, Epb) of elliptic curves over F2161 is constructed with the following properties: (i) the {Gaudry-Hess}-Smart Weil descent attack reduces the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem ({ECDLP}) in {Es(F2161}) to a hyperelliptic curve {DLP} in the Jacobian of a curve of genus 7 or 8, which is computationally feasible, but by far not trivial; (ii) Es is isogenous to Es; (iii) the best attack on the {ECDLP} in {Es(F2161}) is the parallelized Pollard rho method. The curve Es is used just as usual in elliptic curve cryptosystems. The curve Es is submitted to a trusted authority for the purpose of key escrow. The crucial difference from other key escrow scenarios is that the trusted authority has to invest a considerable amount of computation to compromise a user's private key, which makes applications such as widespread wire-tapping impossible.},

Two prominent examples are Jao-De Feo's key exchange protocol and the resulting encryption scheme by De Feo-Jao-Pl{\^u}t. One particularity of the isogeny problems underlying these protocols is that some additional information is given as input, namely the image of some torsion points with order coprime to the isogeny. This additional information was used in several active attacks against the protocols but the current best passive attacks make no use of it at all.},

An interesting feature is the comparatively low bandwidth occupation in key agreement protocols, which stems from the possibility of key compression. However, compression and decompression introduce a significant overhead to the overall processing cost despite recent progress. In this paper we address the main processing bottlenecks involved in key compression and decompression, and suggest substantial improvements for each of them. Some of our techniques may have an independent interest for other, more conventional areas of elliptic curve cryptography as well.},

This is useful for computations in the supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) key-exchange protocol which is one of the more recent contenders in the post-quantum public-key arena. One of the main computational bottlenecks in this cryptographic key-exchange protocol is computing modular arithmetic in a finite field defined by a prime of this special shape. Recent implementations already use this special prime shape to speed up the cryptographic implementations but it remains unclear if the choices made are optimal or if one can do better. Our overview shows that in the SIDH setting, where arithmetic over a quadratic extension field is required, the approaches based on Montgomery multiplication are to be preferred. Based on our results, we give selection criteria for such moduli and the outcome of our search reveals that there exist moduli which result in even faster implementations.},

Subsequently, we show that isogeny-based public key cryptography can exploit the fast Kummer surface arithmetic that arises from the theory of theta functions. In particular, we show that chains of 2-isogenies between elliptic curves can instead be computed as chains of Richelot (2, 2)-isogenies between Kummer surfaces. This gives rise to new possibilities for efficient supersingular isogeny-based cryptography.},

We also prove the session-key security of this key exchange in the Canetti--Krawczyk model, and the IND-CPA security of the related public-key encryption scheme, under reasonable assumptions on the hardness of computing isogeny walks. Our systems admit efficient key-validation techniques that yield CCA-secure encryption, thus providing an important step towards efficient post-quantum non-interactive key exchange (NIKE).},

                   collision resistant hash functions from expander
                   graphs in which finding cycles is hard. As examples,
                   we investigate two specific families of optimal
                   expander graphs for provable collision resistant hash
                   function constructions: the families of Ramanujan
                   graphs constructed by {Lubotzky-Phillips}-Sarnak and
                   Pizer respectively. When the hash function is
                   constructed from one of Pizer's Ramanujan graphs,
                   (the set of supersingular elliptic curves over with
                   ℓ-isogenies, ℓ a prime different from p), then
                   collision resistance follows from hardness of
                   computing isogenies between supersingular elliptic
                   curves. For the {LPS} graphs, the underlying hard
                   problem is a representation problem in group theory.
                   Constructing our hash functions from optimal expander
                   graphs implies that the outputs closely approximate
                   the uniform distribution. This property is useful for
                   arguing that the output is indistinguishable from
                   random sequences of bits. We estimate the cost per
                   bit to compute these hash functions, and we implement
                   our hash function for several members of the Pizer
                   and {LPS} graph families and give actual timings.},

  abstract  = {We provide a new identification protocol and new signature schemes based on isogeny problems. Our identification protocol relies on the hardness of the endomorphism ring computation problem, arguably the hardest of all problems in this area, whereas the only previous scheme based on isogenies (due to De Feo, Jao and Pl{\^u}t) relied on potentially easier problems. The protocol makes novel use of an algorithm of Kohel-Lauter-Petit-Tignol for the quaternion version of the {\$}{\$}{\backslash}ell {\$}{\$}ℓ-isogeny problem, for which we provide a more complete description and analysis. Our new signature schemes are derived from the identification protocols using the Fiat-Shamir (respectively, Unruh) transforms for classical (respectively, post-quantum) security. We study their efficiency, highlighting very small key sizes and reasonably efficient signing and verification algorithms.},

While the existing schemes are proven from the standard DBDH assumption, our reinforced secure ones have two incomparable security proofs: one is proven from the DBDH as well and another is proven from the Isog-DDH assumption which is incomparable with DBDH. As a result, if either DBDH or Isog-DDH assumption holds, the proposed HIBE/ABE schemes are secure. For obtaining our (H)IBE secure in the standard model, we assign a unique (product) group called ID-group to each (H)ID, and introduce a new proof technique, i.e., ID-group partitioning by using isogenies as trapdoors.},

This class group is central to the CSIDH-512 isogeny based cryptosystem, and knowing the class group structure and relation lattice implies efficient uniform sampling and a canonical representation of its elements. Both operations were impossible before and allow us to instantiate an isogeny based signature scheme first sketched by Stolbunov. We further optimize the scheme using multiple public keys and Merkle trees, following an idea by De Feo and Galbraith. We also show that including quadratic twists allows to cut the public key size in half for free. Optimizing for signature size, our implementation takes 390 ms to sign/verify and results in signatures of 263 bytes, at the expense of a large public key. This is 300 times faster and over 3 times smaller than an optimized version of SeaSign for the same parameter set. Optimizing for public key and signature size combined, results in a total size of 1468 bytes, which is smaller than any other post-quantum signature scheme at the 128-bit security level.},

    abstract = {This paper aims to address the open problem, namely, to find new techniques to design and prove security of supersingular isogeny-based authenticated key exchange (AKE) protocols against the widest possible adversarial attacks, raised by Galbraith in 2018. Concretely, we present two AKEs based on a double-key PKE in the supersingular isogeny setting secure in the sense of CK{\$}{\$}^+{\$}{\$}, one of the strongest security models for AKE. Our contributions are summarised as follows. Firstly, we propose a strong OW-CPA secure PKE, {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}2PKE{\_}{\{}sidh{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}, based on SI-DDH assumption. By applying modified Fujisaki-Okamoto transformation, we obtain a [OW-CCA, OW-CPA] secure KEM, {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}2KEM{\_}{\{}sidh{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}. Secondly, we propose a two-pass AKE, {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}SIAKE{\}}{\_}2{\$}{\$}, based on SI-DDH assumption, using {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}2KEM{\_}{\{}sidh{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$} as a building block. Thirdly, we present a modified version of {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}2KEM{\_}{\{}sidh{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$} that is secure against leakage under the 1-Oracle SI-DH assumption. Using the modified {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}2KEM{\_}{\{}sidh{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$} as a building block, we then propose a three-pass AKE, {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}SIAKE{\}}{\_}3{\$}{\$}, based on 1-Oracle SI-DH assumption. Finally, we prove that both {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}SIAKE{\}}{\_}2{\$}{\$} and {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}SIAKE{\}}{\_}3{\$}{\$} are CK{\$}{\$}^+{\$}{\$} secure in the random oracle model and supports arbitrary registration. We also provide an implementation to illustrate the efficiency of our schemes. Our schemes compare favourably against existing isogeny-based AKEs. To the best of our knowledge, they are the first of its kind to offer security against arbitrary registration, wPFS, KCI, and MEX simultaneously. Regarding efficiency, our schemes outperform existing schemes in terms of bandwidth as well as CPU cycle count.},

A recent line of work has proposed and further improved compression of public keys, leading to the inclusion of public-key compression in the SIKE proposal for Round 2 of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization effort. We show how to employ the dual isogeny to significantly increase performance of compression techniques, reducing their overhead from 160--182{\%} to 77--86{\%} for Alice's key generation and from 98--104{\%} to 59--61{\%} for Bob's across different SIDH parameter sets. For SIKE, we reduce the overhead of (1) key generation from 140--153{\%} to 61--74{\%}, (2) key encapsulation from 67--90{\%} to 38--57{\%}, and (3) decapsulation from 59--65{\%} to 34--39{\%}. This is mostly achieved by speeding up the pairing computations, which has until now been the main bottleneck, but we also improve (deterministic) basis generation.},

It is a generalization of the one-way group homomorphism [IY88], which was not powerful enough to capture the bit commitment scheme based on graph isomorphism [BC86b]. It provides a unified theory for all the known bit commitment schemes that offer unconditional protection for the originator of the commitments, and for many of those that offer her statistical protection. (Unconditional protection means that the value of the bit committed to is always perfectly concealed. Statistical protection either means that this is almost always the case, or that only an arbitrarily small probabilistic bias about this bit can leak; in either cases, statistical protection must hold even against unlimited computing power.)},

However, the implementation by Castryck et al. is not constant-time. Specifically, a part of the secret key could be recovered by the side-channel attacks. Recently, Meyer, Campos, and Reith proposed a constant-time implementation of {CSIDH} by introducing dummy isogenies and taking secret exponents only from intervals of non-negative integers. Their non-negative intervals make the calculation cost of their implementation of {CSIDH} twice that of the worst case of the standard (variable-time) implementation of CSIDH. In this paper, we propose a more efficient constant-time algorithm that takes secret exponents from intervals symmetric with respect to the zero. For using these intervals, we need to keep two torsion points on an elliptic curve and calculation for these points. We implemented our algorithm by extending the implementation in C of Meyer et al. (originally from Castryck et al.). Then our implementation achieved 152.8 million clock cycles, which is about 29.03{\%} faster than that of Meyer et al.},

Recently, two constant-time versions of {CSIDH} have been proposed: first by Meyer, Campos and Reith, and then by Onuki, Aikawa, Yamazaki and Takagi. While both offer protection against timing attacks and simple power consumption analysis, they are vulnerable to more powerful attacks such as fault injections. In this work, we identify and repair two oversights in these algorithms that compromised their constant-time character. By exploiting Edwards arithmetic and optimal addition chains, we produce the fastest constant-time version of {CSIDH} to date. We then consider the stronger attack scenario of fault injection, which is relevant for the security of {CSIDH} static keys in embedded hardware. We propose and evaluate a dummy-free {CSIDH} algorithm. While these {CSIDH} variants are slower, their performance is still within a small constant factor of less-protected variants. Finally, we discuss derandomized {CSIDH} algorithms.},

However, the performance is rather slow. Therefore, we employ some techniques to speed up the algorithms, mainly by restructuring the elliptic curve point multiplications and by using twisted Edwards curves in the isogeny image curve computations, yielding a speed-up factor of 1.33 in comparison to the implementation of Castryck et al.

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a polynomial-time algorithm to compute a connecting {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal {\{}O{\}}{\$}{\$}-ideal between two supersingular elliptic curves over {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbb {\{}F{\}}{\_}p{\$}{\$} with common {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbb {\{}F{\}}{\_}p{\$}{\$}-endomorphism ring {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal {\{}O{\}}{\$}{\$}, given a description of their full endomorphism rings. This algorithm provides a reduction of the security of the {CSIDH} cryptosystem to the problem of computing endomorphism rings of supersingular elliptic curves. A similar reduction for SIDH appeared at Asiacrypt 2016, but relies on totally different techniques. Furthermore, we also show that any supersingular elliptic curve constructed using the complex-multiplication method can be located precisely in the supersingular isogeny graph by explicitly deriving a path to a known base curve. This result prohibits the use of such curves as a building block for a hash function into the supersingular isogeny graph.},

In this paper, we demonstrate that the van Oorschot-Wiener golden collision finding algorithm has a lower cost (but higher running time) for solving CSSI, and thus should be used instead of the meet-in-the-middle attack to assess the security of SIDH against classical attacks. The smaller parameter p brings significantly improved performance for SIDH.},

Recent works have shown how to build efficient (public-key) primitives from isogeny-based assumptions such as {CSIDH} and {CSI-FiSh}. However, in its present form, the landscape of isogenies does not seem very amenable to realizing new cryptographic applications. Isogeny-based assumptions often have unique efficiency and security properties, which makes building new cryptographic applications from them a potentially tedious and time-consuming task.},

If {\$}{\$}p {\backslash}equiv 7 {\backslash}bmod 8{\$}{\$} then horizontal 2-isogenies can be used to help compute the class group action. The formulas we derive for these 2-isogenies are very efficient (they basically amount to a single exponentiation in {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbf {\{}F{\}}{\_}p{\$}{\$}) and allow for a noticeable speed-up, e.g., our resulting CSURF-512 protocol runs about {\$}{\$}5.68{\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$} faster than CSIDH-512. This improvement is completely orthogonal to all previous speed-ups, constant-time measures and construction of cryptographic primitives that have appeared in the literature so far. At the same time, moving to the surface gets rid of the redundant factor {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbf {\{}Z{\}}{\_}3{\$}{\$} of the acting ideal-class group, which is present in the case of CSIDH and offers no extra security.},

  abstract = {In AsiaCrypt 2017, Galbraith-Petit-Silva proposed a digital signature scheme based on the problem of computing the endomorphism ring of a supersingular elliptic curve. This problem is more standard than that of the De Feo-Jao-Pl{\^u}t SIDH scheme, since it lacks the auxiliary points which lead to the adaptive active attack of Galbraith-Petit-Shani-Ti. The GPS signature scheme applies the Fiat-Shamir or Unruh transformation to the raw identification protocol obtained from the endomorphism ring problem, and makes use of the Kohel-Lauter-Petit-Tignol quaternion isogeny path algorithm to find a new ideal. However, the GPS signature scheme is not very practical. In this paper, we take a first step towards quantifying the efficiency of the GPS signature scheme. We propose some improvements in the underlying algorithms for the GPS scheme, along with a new method which trades off key size for signature size to decrease the signature size from around 11 kB to 1 kB at the 128-bit security level by using multi-bit challenges. We also provide a concrete implementation of the GPS signature scheme using Sage and CoCalc.},

The core idea in SeaSign is to apply the ``Fiat--Shamir with aborts'' transform to the parallel repeated execution of an identification scheme based on CSIDH. We optimize this general transform by allowing the prover to not answer a limited number of said parallel executions, thereby lowering the overall probability of rejection. The performance improvement ranges between factors of approximately 4.4 and 65.7 for various instantiations of the scheme, at the expense of roughly doubling the signature sizes.},
